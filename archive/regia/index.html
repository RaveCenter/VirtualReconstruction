					<h1>3rd and 5th phase Regias</h1>
					<p>The Regia was first excavated in the late nineteenth century. Its earliest levels were subsequently explored by the American Academy in Rome in the mid-1960s, although the reports from these excavations have yet to be fully published. The Regia is a relatively small building on the Via Sacra across the street from the Temple of Vesta in the Roman Forum. Its construction has been attributed to Numa, Rome’s second king, but it is unlikely that it functioned as a domestic residence for an extended period of time, if at all. By the middle of the sixth century, multiple religious spaces occupied the structure.
					<br><br> 
					 The Regia likely underwent five different phases of reconstruction, not including several minor periods of remodeling. Each of these five phases exhibit cappellaccio foundations and probably had mud-brick walls with terracotta roofs.
					 <br> <br>
					  For our virtual reconstruction of the Regia, we have decided to focus on two phases: the third and the fifth. Although the Regia’s third phase offers scanty archaeological evidence concerning its structure, its roof, which was adorned by a variety of architectural terracottas, provides compelling reconstruction possibilities. By contrast, the Regia’s fifth phase persisted for at least 800 years. For this reason, our reconstruction of the Regia’s fifth phase emphasizes the structure’s social functions while highlighting the building’s physical materiality.

					  In this map, the Regia is circled in red and a green arrow points to the Temple of Vesta.</p>
