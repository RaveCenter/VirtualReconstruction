# VirtualReconstruction

Welcome to the Rice University Virtual Reconstruction of Historical Cities course webpage!

This site is a product of collaboration between students and faculty in the Rice University Schools of Humanities, Social Sciences, Architecture, and Engineering.

Over the course of a semester we reconstructed three historical sites in a virtual navigable environment. Under the supervision of professors, but working in independent study, students researched the archaeology of these sites as well as contemporaneous architecture, then modeled each building using Rhinoceros and Blender before integrating the buildings into Unity 3D.

This is the fruit of that collaboration.*

Enjoy!
